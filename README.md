# Offline-Thesaurus-JSON-
Most basic code you will find on all of GitHub
My first project on GitHub
# What can it do?
1. Find all the words in our dataset which match with the user input 
2. Identify if the word is similar to any word in dataset(Did you mean this?)
3. Display properties of the word that user entered like noun/verb/adj 
4. Give us synonyms of the given word
5. And absolutely nothing else

# Open to any suggestion or improvement
This project was created for people who have never made any applications. Its very simple and and straightforard. If you are new to python coding this will be good practice for you

# Credits
Thanks to [Šarūnas Navickas](http://zaibacu.github.io/) for making the dataset available for everyone to use.
